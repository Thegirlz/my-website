<h1>Graphic Design Jobs</h1>
<p style="color:#6D305B">A lot of people tend to think that Graphic Design jobs are only drawing
digitally and in a slight sense they are correct but most incorrect.Graphic
Design jobs can be simple yet interesting jobs. Such as Advertising. That is a
job most people go around thinking that it only incliudesphotography.Indeed
there are those cliche jobs such as Web Design,Interface Design,Paper
Engineering,Animators,Infographs,Signage,Art and Installitions and ofcourse Digital Art.
There are more but i have chosen these because of how they not neccesssarily
appreciated by non-graphic designer. Except for Digital Art.
Everyone knows that one.</p>

<h1>What is the most important role a of Graphic Designers?</h1>
<p style="color:#6D305B">This is going to be a very simple yet odd answer. If
one thinks in general of what the most important role of a person who works is,
it should be to provide the services that the customer wants and to meet their
needs.With Graphic Designing the answer has more to it. it is managing client
proposals from typestting through design production and print.Simple Yet Odd.</p>

<h1>What are the pros and cons of being a Graphic Designer?</h1>
<p style="color:#6D305B">There are pros and cons of doing this going into this section of work.
The pros and cons can seem like normal pros and cons of having a jobs but they
are different to Graphic Designers.The pros of Graphic Designing are that they
can stay indoors to work and can stay up-to-date with the lastest technology.
They can work as Self-Employed and there are many more. I in fact want to
discuss a certain Con. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT LOVE YOUR ARTWORK THEN EVERTHING WILL BE
HARDER FOR YOU TO CREATE THE ARTWORK</strong>.A Graphic Designer has to love
their work or else they will not be great in what they do.
To be a Graphic Designer you must have passion.</p>
