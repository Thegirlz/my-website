<h1>What is Graphic Design?</h1>

<p>Graphic Design is the ability/skill to combine text,image,colour and more.
Graphic Designs are commonly found in pictures;advertisments,magazines and
even books.But there is indeed more to Graphic Design which i will be explaining
in more detail. Graphic Design has two parts to it. Graphic and Design. I shall
be explaining Graphic.Now Graphic means visual and if one thinks of visual it
 would commonly be associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art</li>
<li>Imagination</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Expression and More.</li>
</ul>
<p>This involves many mediums such as drawing,painting,lettering, etc etc.
So the Graphic part of Graphic Design is made up of visual or well known as art
elements.The basic visual/art elements that are used to combine Graphic Design
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line</li>
<li>Tone</li>
<li>Texture</li>
<li>Shape</li>
<li>Colour</li>
<li>Typography</li>
</ul>
<p>These visual elements are often chosen and arranged on a surface in a layout
  to grant an idea.</p>

<p>The previous part of Graphic Design was well,Graphic.The part i am now going
  to explain is the second part of Graphic Design which is Design.
Design is to decide on how it is to look and the function of somethimg before it
 is made.In lament terms Design is</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking</li>
<li>Problem solving</li>
<li>Feasibility</li>
</ul>
<p>In Graphic Design there are rules that can be used.These rules are known as
the "Principles Of Design."These Principles have a relationship between each
other and appear in every designed piece of work one would see.
The Key Principles of design are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Balance</li>
<li>Rhythm/Movement</li>
<li>Emphasis</li>
<li>Contrast</li>
<li>Proportion</li>
</ul>
<p>When we bring Visual/Art elements
and the Design Principles togethwer we have GRAPHIC DESIGN. </p>

<h3><u>The summary of What Graphic Design is:</h3></u>
<p>The organisation and presentation of information developed through a
creative process for a particular function.It is not just painting or drawing or
quickly designing a poster.It has more meaning.It is only once we have a solid
idea,developed through thr design process we can use our skills with layout
colour,typography and creative tools to bring that idea to life.</p>
